Purpose: The STAR PWA aims to systematically assess and categorize the reading levels of non-readers (students with limited or no reading proficiency) at Tropical Village National High School. It will use speech recognition to evaluate oral reading and comprehension, helping teachers identify students’ reading stages (e.g., pre-reader, emergent reader) and recommend tailored interventions.
Target Users: Teachers and literacy coordinators at Tropical Village National High School, with students as the primary participants during assessments.
Core Features:
Reading Assessment: Students read short passages aloud using speech recognition to capture their pronunciation and fluency.
Level Categorization: Automatically categorize students into reading levels based on accuracy, speed, and comprehension (e.g., non-reader, pre-reader, emergent reader).
Progress Tracking: Store assessment results locally (offline) to track student progress over time.
Teacher Dashboard: Allow teachers to view student profiles, assessment results, and recommended reading strategies.
Offline Support: Enable full functionality in areas with limited internet, common in rural settings like Tropical Village.
PWA Features: Installable on devices, with a native app-like experience and offline caching.
Speech Recognition: Use the Web Speech API to analyze spoken input during reading tasks, with text input as a fallback for unsupported browsers.
Reading Levels (Example Categories):
Non-Reader: Cannot recognize letters or words.
Pre-Reader: Recognizes some letters and sounds but cannot form words.
Emergent Reader: Reads simple words with support but struggles with sentences.
(Further levels can be defined based on school standards.)
Project Structure
The file structure remains similar to the previous suggestion but is tailored to the STAR system’s focus on reading assessment. It’s organized for modularity and scalability, with assets and components specific to reading levels and speech-based evaluation.
